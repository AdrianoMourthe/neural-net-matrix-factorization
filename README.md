# Neural Network Matrix Factorization (NNMF)
An implementation of Dziugaite and Roy's "Neural Network Matrix Factorization" model (https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06443), as well as a proposed extension which makes use of stochastic variational inference to learn an approximate posterior distribution over the latent space.
