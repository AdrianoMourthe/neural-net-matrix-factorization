# Neural Network Matrix Factorization (NNMF)
Tensorflow prototypes of:
* Dziugaite and Roy's "Neural Network Matrix Factorization" (NNMF) model (https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06443).
* A proposed extension which makes use of stochastic variational inference to learn an approximate posterior distribution over the latent space.
